## Overview
This is a cool retro feeling game which includes both control input from the user's device but also allows for voice commands in the game. The voice control aspect of the game
adds a great new way for a user to interact with a game in a simple yet effective way. The game is a simple game where the character who is called "Ghost" ventures through levels
which have a super mario type of feeling to them. Along the way Ghost encounters enemies and coins. Enemies are bad and harm Ghost's progression through the game but the coins are 
to be collected by Ghost both gold and silver.
