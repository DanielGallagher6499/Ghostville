## Overview
This is a cool retro feeling game which includes both control input from the user's device but also allows for voice commands in the game. The voice control aspect of the game
adds a great new way for a user to interact with a game in a simple yet effective way. The game is a simple game where the character who is called "Ghost" ventures through levels
which have a super mario type of feeling to them. Along the way Ghost encounters enemies and coins. Enemies are bad and harm Ghost's progression through the game but the coins are 
to be collected by Ghost both gold and silver. I know in comparision to people using advanced things with their games such as VR etc it seems slightly smaller but I have tried to get this game to as close of a level as a completed game as I could with custom fonts, animations and an overall professional approach to the development of this in regards to colours functionailty etc. Obviously I would have loved to work with VR or cool technology but I did not have any at my disposal at the point of creating this game and felt this was just as fun as I would love to get into games development as a career.

## Game Functions
The game is a simple platformer with a great retro feeling to it immersing the player in a mario like game. I made this game with the intent of having an old style mario feel to it while including new aspects which in this case were voice activation commands. The game we developed before this for our first project was of a much lower standard of this. In this game everything from player movement to menus are voice controlled leading to a really cool immersive feeling. Along with this the controls can be used by either keyboard or voice commands. The game is very easy using the keyboard but using voice commands adds a new level of difficulty to the game for anyone playing it.
